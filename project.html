RUN WITH THE DREAM
In recent years, O2O has developed rapidly in China and has
entered a mature market in just a few years. Thanks to this
mode, customers could receive their meal sent by riders within
1 hour without leaving home or pay in cash.

Those riders wearing the distinguishable uniforms and helmets,
however, had to face complicated social environment
and run in the streets and lanes even the worst weather.
Behind their colorful uniform, they are flooded with prejudice
and prejudice, which indicated there still needs a long way to
go before we achieve social equality and social justice.
